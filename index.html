    Hi, my name is Travis Amiel. I'm a senior theatre studies major at Emerson College.
    <br>
    Right now I'm working on a play called <em>Kiss</em> by Guillermo Calderón. <br>
    It is directed by David Dower with ArtsEmerson. <br> It runs October 26th through November 19th.

  Making theatre —writing, performing, dramaturging, doing administrative/producing work— is my main thing. I'm making my website with plain HTML because I want my website to reflect myself as an artist.
  I'm drawn to using cardboard and other trash as props or a canvas.
