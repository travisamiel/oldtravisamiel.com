  <p class="middletext">In the fall of 2017 I audited a class taught by P. Carl called <em>Developing an Aesthetic Sensibility Through Creative and Critical Thinking</em>
    At the core of the class was maintaining a <em>Beauty Portfolio</em>, a record of things we found beautiful.
    This page is an attempt to store what I find beautiful â€” a sort of open-sourcing the development and growth of my aesthetic.
    I used to use Tumblr to keep track of what I found beatutiful, and have been putting images/quotes/etc into Evernote, but it's thrilling to experiment with coding a page that stores all of this.

<p class = "comment">I don't know what to say about this piece more than that it showed me so much about making a flowing ensemble storytelling narrative. It hit on so many aesthetic joys for me, and my jaw dropped for such a long period that I closed my mouth only after I noticed I was drooling on my arm.<br> I saw it at the ICA on 22 October 2017</p>
